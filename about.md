### about me

I'm a software engineer currently working at [vypr](https://vyprclients.com/)

I graduated from [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com) in 2017. I mostly write JavaScript (React), and TypeScript. I really like writing good tests.

### other stuff

When I'm not at work I like weightlifting, reading, cycling, crocheting and puzzles.
