### about me

I'm a software engineer currently working at [Co-op Digital](https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/)

I graduate from [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com) in 2017. I mostly write Python and JavaScript (React). I like TDD. 

### other stuff

When I'm not at work I like reading, cycling, yoga, cooking, crocheting and puzzles.
