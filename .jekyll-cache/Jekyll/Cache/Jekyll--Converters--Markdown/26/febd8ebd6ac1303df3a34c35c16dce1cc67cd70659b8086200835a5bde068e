I"<<p>👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 I joined a new team remotely and I was expecting it to be difficult  -  it was really challenging. there are people at work who have started new jobs and even new CAREERS in lockdown, they’re very impressive!<br />
🛍 It’s the team that looks after the coop delivery service (<a href="https://quickshop.coop.co.uk">here</a> - go get some food, minimum spend £15 and free delivery)<br />
📱 The existing team members are brilliant and really welcoming, but trying to essentially learn a new codebase and domain over the phone is a lot<br />
🕰 I like getting to know my teammates personally and building relationships with them. This is going to be very different and take a long time<br />
🆕 It’s exciting to use some cool new React features and new framworks - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lodash/fp</code> is one<br />
🛒 The project is wholly dependent on someone else’s API which is new for me<br />
👩‍💻 I haven’t worked on a service I use before that I can recall<br />
😴 Way more developers than I’m used to - we are trying to work out the best way for us all to work together so the new team members can learn but we don’t all get totally drained - this isn’t easy<br />
🏆 I won the team Friday quiz. it feels important to mention that</p>
