I"š<p>ğŸšµğŸ»â€â™‚ï¸ - i had a very short week this week because i had the tuesday off as well as the bank holiday. i used the time wisely by literally watching all of the tour de france stages in full<br />
ğŸ’¬ - this week i didnâ€™t do much much coding but a lot of dev team talking. we are about to add to the site a new bit of functionality, and we decided to take some time to think about how we were going to design it and how to break up the work, by having a structured chat with a Miro board. out of this came the kinds of conversations that can flow freely when weâ€™re all the in the same room but seem really easy to not do remotely. it was really, really valuable, and i feel more confident about this bit of work than i have about anything weâ€™ve worked on since i moved teams. the bit of effort we put in to organize these chats really, really paid off.<br />
ğŸŒˆ - for various reasons thereâ€™s been a lot of important and interesting conversations about diversity and inclusion in our organization this week. iâ€™m glad i have an opportunity to help make my workplace and the tech industry as welcoming as possible to anyone who wants to be a part of it</p>
