I"™<p>ğŸ‘©ğŸ¼â€ğŸ« - going to do some mentoring with the apprentice on our team. hopefully as most things I know about coding I learned extremely recently, I can pass on some useful resources<br />
ğŸ‘©â€ğŸ‘©â€ğŸ‘§â€ğŸ‘§ - the team is still working out how to optimize working without everyone mobbing and pairing all day. We still havenâ€™t found the solution but itâ€™s been good to have conversations about it and keep trying to improve<br />
ğŸ§¹ - Iâ€™ve been identifying some housekeeping tasks that will help me get to know the codebase but that arenâ€™t high stakes feature work. Improving the way test data is generated and imported is one of them.<br />
ğŸ“– - Iâ€™ve been working a bit more with our CMS API. This is something I havenâ€™t used at all before, and itâ€™s very nicely structured and documented, so itâ€™s been fun to learn about.<br />
ğŸ’¬ - I did some testing of our site with a screen reader this week which was a very educational experience. It was good to be able to identify ways to make our site even more accessible, and itâ€™ll be useful for me to learn more about implementing them.<br />
Æ› - weâ€™ve been talking about implementing some serverless functions to help us use data better, and Iâ€™m very excited to start creating them. The conversations weâ€™ve had around designing the work have been really interesting.<br />
âš¡ï¸ - I got asked to give a lightning talk Iâ€™ve done before at a meetup in a few weeks. Thisâ€™ll be my first time public speaking to strangers rather than colleagues, so Iâ€™m nervous but also excited.<br />
ğŸ¢ - I have created the team friday funtime quiz this week, so I wonâ€™t win it, but I won it last week</p>
