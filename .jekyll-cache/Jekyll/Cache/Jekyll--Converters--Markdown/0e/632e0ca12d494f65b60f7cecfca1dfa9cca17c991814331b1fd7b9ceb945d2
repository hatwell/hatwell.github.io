I"ß<p>â›…ï¸ - I made an azure function! weâ€™ve been working with serverless on our new project and itâ€™s taken me a while to get to grips with the intricacies of the config. i am pro-serverless for sure but the barrier to entry feels a bit high with getting things up and running. but in collarboartion with my wonderful colleauges i created and deployed the function that our chunky new feature is going to depend on
ğŸ§ª - Iâ€™m going to create a suite of functional tests</p>
