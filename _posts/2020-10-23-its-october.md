🎁 - i'm presenting for the first time since I joined the team at our regular team show and tell, talking about how we're going to develop a new feature that we've just started work on.  
🏞 - our team has been split into several workstreams because the team kept growing and growing and our scope increasing. i think it will make a big difference to our work if we only focus on one or two things at a time.  
🚀 - I've been working through Kent C Dodd's Epic React course. It's really helping me get more of a handle on advanced react features I need to understand. One of the problem I've found isn't that I can't learn things but that it takes me longer than I'd like. Finding someone who teaches the things I need to know in a style that works for me is invaluable.
