This month I only read one non-fiction book, which goes against my plan for the year. I'm lining up some more for March.

in the order I read them:

**Who Will Run The Frog Hospital by Lorrie Moore**
It took me a while to get into this book but eventually I got it, a really tender and funny novel about two young women's friendship, and their time working at a theme park.  

**The Sundown Motel by Simone St James**
A spooky thriller about a young woman who goes to the small town her aunt disappeared from twenty years ago. She takes up her aunt's old job at a run-down motel where are there are ~~strange happenings~~. It was pretty daft but I ate it up quickly. There were some fun supporting characters. 

**Sisters In Hate by Seyward Darby**
This is a non-fiction book telling the different stories of three women involved the far right movement in America. It was pretty bleak, and also a great history of how women's capacity for reproduction and constructions of female virtue have been used to create and bolster raciest narratives and movements.

**Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck**  
I realised recently that I haven't read this, so I did. It's hard to take a book at face value like this when so many other things refer to it and reference it, when you already know the plot because you've seen it parodied a hundred times on The Simpsons. I love Steinbeck's style and always find his books completely absorbing and this was no exception.

**Luster by Raven Leilani**
I'd seen so many rave reviews of this book and they stood up - a really real and funny book about a young woman who starts dating a married man and the relationship that develops between her and his family. I don't want to say more and spoil it.

**The Patient by Jasper Dewitt**
Terrible. What started out as a fun and readable Gothic story about a young doctor who starts working in a creepy New England asylum turned into total nonsense, and when I finished the book I learned from the Acknowledgements it was actually a story someone posted on r/noSleep. I'm really annoyed I read it. Don't read it. 

**Girl A by Abigail Dean**
This is a novel about a young woman who escaped with her siblings from a tabloid-fodder "House of Horrors", and the different ways they have dealt with the trauma of their childhood. I thought this was really well wriiten, never salacious and very touching.
