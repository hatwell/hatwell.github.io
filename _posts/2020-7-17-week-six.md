👩🏼‍🏫 - going to do some mentoring with the apprentice on our team. hopefully as most things I know about coding I learned extremely recently, I can pass on some useful resources  
👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 - the team is still working out how to optimize working without everyone mobbing and pairing all day. We still haven't found the solution but it's been good to have conversations about it and keep trying to improve  
🧹 - I've been identifying some housekeeping tasks that will help me get to know the codebase but that aren't high stakes feature work. Improving the way test data is generated and imported is one of them.  
📖 - I've been working a bit more with our CMS API. This is something I haven't used at all before, and it's very nicely structured and documented, so it's been fun to learn about.
💬 - I did some testing of our site with a screen reader this week which was a very educational experience. It was good to be able to identify ways to make our site even more accessible, and it'll be useful for me to learn more about implementing them.  
ƛ - we've been talking about implementing some serverless functions to help us use data better, and I'm very excited to start creating them. The conversations we've had around designing the work have been really interesting.  
⁉️ - I have created the team friday funtime quiz this week, so I won't win it, but I won it last week
