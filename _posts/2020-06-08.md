I joined a new team remotely and I was expecting it to be diffciult and it was really challenging
I like getting to know my teamamtes personally and builing relationships with them. Doing that remotely feels much harder and I don't want to force anything
It's exciting to use some cool new React features and new framworks
The project is wholly dependent on someone else's API which is new for me
I haven't worked on a service I use before that I can recall
I won the team Friday quiz, feels important to mention thatWay more developer than I'm used to - we are trying to work out the best way for us all to work together so the new team members can learn but we don't all get totally drained - this isn't easy
