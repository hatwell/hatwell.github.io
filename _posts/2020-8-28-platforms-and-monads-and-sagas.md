🧐 - this week i have spent a lot of time trying to get to grips with redux saga. i can see the benefits of it at a high level but it involves a lot of abstractions that i'm still a bit uneasy with. i definitely know lots more this week that i did last week  
🔑 - i've been pairing with a platform engineer this week working on setting up two-key deployment for our production jenkins, i am not sure how helpful i was as a pairing partner but it's great to learn more about deployment and how stuff fits together in jenkins  
📦 - i _might_ have some more of a clue what a monad is this week  
👩‍💻 - today i ran Code Club, our weekly session where we work on code katas. loads more people turned up than usual (because we've moved it to a friday) and it was lots and lots of fun, spent some time thinking pretty deeply about where to start writing tests and at what point in writing which tests to start designing an implementation
