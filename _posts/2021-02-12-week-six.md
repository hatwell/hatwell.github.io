📈 - this week I levelled up as a software engineer! i got a lil promotion. i haven't started the new role yet but I'm very happy to have gone from a Junior Engineer to an Engineer!  
🔁 - It was the second class of my [Upskilling in Devops](https://www.techreturners.com/programmes/devops-upskill) course. We were talking about cloud providers and mostly discussing the dumb AWS names for things. Did you know Azure's SQL database service is just called Azure SQL Database?  
🧶 - We had an etremely tedious problem with a linter and disparate versions of Typescript and ES Lint that took five enginners a mob afternoon to sort. It was extremely dry. 
🪙 - learned some stuff about JWTs and a bit more about verification. that's been a gap in my knowledge for a while so it was good to learn more.  
📈 - got to do some GraphQL!! at work!! first time that's happened and it was really exciting.  
💉 - my mum and dad got vaccinated!!!! literally the best news I've had in....a long time.
