## things i have observed

### crystal

the difficulty of having two bosses - one command and control, one celebrating learning from failure, and not having the experience to recognise each for what they were and get the benefits.

keeping an issue/solutions tracker. don't have to figure out how to fix the same thing twice. get better at writing everything down.

### RoS

getting the ground up "innovation" with no buy-in or road to production for the things that were conceived of or built as a result.
no visibility of services, leading to teams rebuilding the same things.
so you'd have some kind of marketplace / catalogue of services and their documentation? but who looks after that? someone would have to liaise with every team and understand what their services did and what their APIs were.

### Co-op

### AND

### Vypr

- can i make an NPM package of our components so they can be easily imported and shared?
