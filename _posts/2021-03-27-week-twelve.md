ðŸ¤¯ - this week has been unbelievably hard, for a variety of reasons. We had to deal with a an issue that could have potentially impacted thousands of users and kept butting up against processes in our efforts to rectify this. It was one of those situations where no matter how I was feeling I had to keep reminding myself that everyone is trying to do a good job based on what information they have at the time.  
ðŸ¤  - i have been feeling more confident lately, a combination of the impact of my amazing DevOps course, my brilliant team and reminding myself that I am a grown-ass woman who has been doing this slightly hard thing for years now and it's fine for me to speak up.
