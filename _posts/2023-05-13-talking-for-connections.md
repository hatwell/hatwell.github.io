## things that i have done to make human connections with my co-workers

- if someone mentions kids / pets, always ask what they are, how old they are. people love talking about their families and you'll get a sense of what their life is like
- after a lunch break, ask people what they had for lunch / what they're having for dinner.
- ask about previous jobs, what worked well there, what didn't.
- last photo on their phone. getting people to talk about themselves by asking them about the small, low-stakes details of their lives. it's not "sell yourself", it's not "what's an _interesting_ fact about you, it's just getting people to open up because everyone has lunch, everyone knows how old their kid is. Then you can say "oh i've got a niece that age", "oh yeah my husband loves to cook that but I can't do it", things that help people connect and feel comfortable talking to each other.
- when people resist this stuff, why is it? they feel self-conscious? they have worked somewhere that faked this kind of safety stuff? they've been burned in the past? they don't know what it's like to work in a high trust environment?
- I have my good memory so I find it really easy to remember people's names, partner's names, jobs etc. how can you make this level of connection happen for people to whom that doesn't come easily?
- should a developer be thinking about this stuff?
