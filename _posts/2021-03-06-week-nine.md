🚑 - used some stuff I learned in my DevOps class when we had an outage this week. "let's scale up the pods" - me  
💯 - our wonderful engineering apprentice passed her software methodologies exam this week!! (turns out the answer to most of them was "agile")  
⭐️ - had a couple of chats about confidence, and how I need to have more, a lot more, especially since I got promoted. the negative voice in my head is still convinced i'm stealing a living at work and i need to step up and get over myself a bit.  
🤖 - made a change to get more automated tests into our pipeline, which was loads of fun
