👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 I joined a new team remotely and I was expecting it to be difficult  -  it was really challenging. there are people at work who have started new jobs and even new CAREERS in lockdown, they're very impressive!  
🛍 It's the team that looks after the coop delivery service (https://quickshop.coop.co.uk/ - go get some food, minimum spend £15 and free delivery)  
📱 The existing team members are brilliant and really welcoming, but trying to essentially learn a new codebase and domain over the phone is a lot  
🕰 I like getting to know my teammates personally and building relationships with them. This is going to be very different and take a long time  
🆕 It's exciting to use some cool new React features and new framworks - `lodash/fp` is one  
🛒 The project is wholly dependent on someone else's API which is new for me  
👩‍💻 I haven't worked on a service I use before that I can recall  
😴 Way more developers than I'm used to - we are trying to work out the best way for us all to work together so the new team members can learn but we don't all get totally drained - this isn't easy  
🏆 I won the team Friday quiz. it feels important to mention that
