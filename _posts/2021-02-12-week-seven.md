🦷 - i had to go to the emergency dentist this week but on the plus side i was greeted by Marcus Rashford when i got there  
🤯 - this week we has some very honest conversations in our team about how people were dealing with remote collaboration (mobbing especially). i am not dealing with it very well! because of what we are working on at the moment and how our knowledge is spread, three/four of us are usually on a call together for most of the working day. people talk about the drain of lots of remote meetings but for ages I'd thought (wrongly) that mobbing didn't count as a meeting, when in fact it is potentially more draining that a meeting, because it's often a meeting, but with no fixed end time, and a lot of it usually spent banging your head against a wall. the amount of time we spend on mobbing makes me so uninclined to spend my evening on more free-form video calls, so it's having an impact.  
👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 - as a team we're appreciating that everyone is struggling with this so coming up with strategies to deal with it - one that's been mooted is having a day soon with no calls at all, and seeing how that works. it will definitely be interesting but i'm glad the conversation is happening, that we can be honest with each other, and that our team is very supportive.  
🤐 - coding wise i've been learning a bit more about authentication with tokens and encryption, which has been something i've found hard to wrap my head around in the past. my knowledge has definitely improved a bit.  
🎤 - i hosted this month's community of practice meeting, which is a bit like being a shit radio DJ in the kitchen and making terrible jokes and hearing no one laughing. it was, as always super fun to see what eevryone's been up to and genuinely thrilling to see some faces I hadn't seen in months when people turned their cameras on.
