☎️ To get to know the team a bit better I set up calls with the product owner and the delivery manager. The idea of these was so I could get to know them and the team history a bit better. The PO joined the company just before lockdown so I'd never met him IRL. As I was finding forming relationships with the new team very hard, this made a difference. It was only an hour, but I now feel like it'll be easy to work with them in the future.  
👩‍🏫 I helped our software apprentice get some code committed this week.   
🇸🇨 I've been deleting old feature flags from the code. This means some tech debt tickets get cleared up, I get to learn my way around the codebase a bit better, and I get to do two things I love: tidying up, and deleting code.  
🏆 I came second out of 50 participants in the Retail IT friday quiz. i then did not win a single game in our team codenames session.
